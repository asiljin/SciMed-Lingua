FEES AND PAYMENTS
THIS IS A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE THAT AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS.

YOU MUST AFFIRMATIVELY CANCEL A SUBSCRIPTION OR A FREE TRIAL (IF ANY) TO AVOID BEING CHARGED IN YOUR APP STORE’S ACCOUNT SETTINGS AT LEAST 24 HOURS BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL OR THE CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD. IF YOU ARE UNSURE HOW TO CANCEL A SUBSCRIPTION OR A FREE TRIAL, PLEASE VISIT THE APPLE SUPPORT WEBSITE, GOOGLE PLAY HELP OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE APP STORE SUPPORT PAGES. DELETING THE APP DOES NOT CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTIONS AND FREE TRIALS. YOU MAY WISH TO MAKE A PRINTSCREEN OF THIS INFORMATION FOR YOUR REFERENCE.

• The App is free to download. However, certain features of the Service are offered on a subscription basis for a fee. You will pay the app store from which you have downloaded the App (the “App Store”) the applicable fees (and any related taxes) as they become due.
• To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change subscription fees at any time. We will give You a reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the App. If You do not wish to pay the new fees, You can cancel the applicable subscription prior to the change going into effect.
• You authorize the App Store to charge the applicable fees to the payment card that You submit.
• By signing up for certain subscriptions, You agree that Your subscription may be automatically renewed. Unless You cancel Your subscription, You authorize the App Store to charge You for the renewal term. The period of auto-renewal will be the same as Your initial subscription period unless otherwise disclosed to You on the Service. The renewal rate will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior subscription period, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless we notify You of a rate change prior to Your auto-renewal. You must cancel Your subscription in accordance with the cancellation procedures disclosed to You for the particular subscription. We will not refund fees that may have accrued to Your account and will not prorate fees for a cancelled subscription.
• We may offer a free trial subscription for the Service. Free trial (if any) provides You with access to the Service for a period of time, with details specified when You sign up for the offer. Unless You cancel before the end of the free trial, or unless otherwise stated, Your access to the Service will automatically continue and You will be billed the applicable fees for the Service. We may send You a reminder when Your free trial is about to end, but we do not guarantee any such notifications. It is ultimately Your responsibility to know when the free trial will end. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to modify or terminate any free trial offer, Your access to the Service during the free trial, or any of these terms without notice and with no liability. We reserve the right to limit Your ability to take advantage of multiple free trials.
• The Service and Your rights to use it expire at the end of the paid period of Your subscription. If You do not pay the fees or charges due, we may make reasonable efforts to notify You and resolve the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or terminate Your access to the Service (and may do so without notice).
• Subscriptions purchased via an App Store are subject to such App Store's refund policies. This means we cannot grant refunds. You will have to contact an App Store support.
